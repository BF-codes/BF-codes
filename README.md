### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Benjamin, from GÃ¶ttingen - Germany. I'm a teacher on the journey to become a Front-End Developer.

In my freetime I enjoy reading, playing videogames, cooking and attending football matches all over Germany.

I'm currently working on the ['The Odin Project'](https://www.theodinproject.com) (TOP) Javascript curriculum. Since I'm still working as a teacher full-time I aim to finish the curriculum in June 2022!

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on redoing the foundations (Git, HTML, CSS), since it's been quite a while since my first try at TOP.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the Odin Project Fullstack JS course
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: coming soon
