### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Benjamin, from GÃ¶ttingen - Germany. I'm a teacher on the journey to become a Web Developer.

In my freetime I enjoy reading, playing videogames, cooking and attending football matches all over Germany.

I'm currently learning Spring Boot. Before that I learned Basic and Intermediate Java and refreshed my knowledge about HTML, CSS and Responsive Web Design.

- ðŸ”­ I'll code my very own online shop with the help of Spring!
- ðŸŒ± To do that I'll obviously have to learn the in-and-outs of Spring :)
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: coming soon
